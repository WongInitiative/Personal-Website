          <p> Spider quest is an arcade-style game coded in Unity where you play as a spider that defeats enemies by creating web loops around them. When you create a complete loop of webs, all the enemies within the loop will be defeated, increasing your score. However, deploying webs will lower your speed, so use them wisely. Every enemy has a unique movement pattern that will force the player to make quick decisions on the fly. Be aware that the pace of the game accelerates the longer you survive. Good luck webbing! </p>
          <p> Movement: WASD / Arrow Keys </p>
          <p> Deploy Web: Space Bar (Hold) </p>
          <p> Pause: P / Esc </p>
          <p> Start: Enter </p>
          <p></p>
          <p> This game was created as a passion project between friends.</p>

          <p> MyMalloc is my own implementation of C's malloc function for dynamic memory allocation. </p>
          <p> This project was designed to mimic the low-level logic behind C's &lt;stdlib.h&gt; malloc() & free(). It internally uses a 4096 byte array to simulate heap memory, and a firstfit algorithm for memory management. </p>

          <p>I built this website to showcase my skills and experience. I used a standard HTML, Javascript, and CSS stack. In addition, I used the Three.js Javascript library to create the animated 3D graphics you see in the background! ViteJS was also used to speed up development. ViteJS is a build tool which provides a faster and leaner development environment for modern web projects.</p>

        <h2>üíª Work History</h2>
        <h3>RCSB Protein Data Bank</h3>
        <h4>Software Engineer Intern</h4>
        <p>During the summer of 2020, I had the pleasure of working as a Software Engineer Intern at the Research Collaboratory of Structural Bioinformatics: Protein Data Bank. During my internship I was tasked with data organization, cleansing, and visualization for the PDB website's protein search/query tool. By building queries in MongoDB, I highlighted visually apparent data trends so as to provide insight on how users were interacting with the website's protein search function. I used MongoDB Charts for visualization in order to preserve native MongoDB functionalities, as the company was already using MongoDB for database management.</p>
        <h3>Stoke Therapeutics</h3>
        <h4>Software Engineer Intern</h4>
        <p>I worked as a Software Engineer Intern at Stoke Therapeutics during the Summer of 2018. My task was to automate the process of designing and ordering oligonucleotides (molecules used by Stoke's scientists to develop medication for genetic diseases). The project was coded in Python, and driven by Snakemake -a workflow management tool used to create reproducable and scalable data analyses. After the core of the project was completed, I obtained requirements and security standards from Stoke's scientists in order to create a secure front-end interface for internal use. This interface was put together using HTML, Javascript, JQuery, and CSS (with Bootstrap).</p>
        <h3>Baskin Robbins</h3>
        <h4>Crewmate</h4>
        <p>During the entirety of 2016-2017, and 2021-2022, I worked as a crewmate for a multinational chain of ice cream stores known as Baskin Robbins. Even though the direction of my career has changed, I still value my experience working in the service industry. At this job, I learned various soft skills such as communication, time-management, and teamwork. This job also taught me about responsibility, accountability, and professionalism; Qualities which have translated directly into my work as a programmer.</p>
